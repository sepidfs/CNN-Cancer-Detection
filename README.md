# CNN-Cancer-Detection
This project tackles the Histopathologic Cancer Detection challenge on Kaggle, where the objective is to classify small histopathology image patches as either containing metastatic cancer (1) or not (0). The dataset consists of more than 275,000 RGB patches with dimensions 96×96, extracted from larger digital pathology scans.

 Dataset (Kaggle Competition):

The work includes exploratory data analysis, image preprocessing, data loading pipelines, development of multiple CNN-based architectures, performance evaluation with metrics such as AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and generation of a submission file for Kaggle evaluation.
